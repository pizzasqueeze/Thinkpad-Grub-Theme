# Thinkpad-Grub-Theme

This is an edit of the [Poly Dark Grub Theme](https://github.com/shvchk/poly-dark) made by [Andrei Shevchuk](https://github.com/shvchk). This theme borrows the icons from the [Urko Mint Dark GFX Boot Theme](https://store.kde.org/p/1233574/) and has a custom background that I made in Inkscape.

### Installation / update
Instructions based on [Andrei Shevchuk](https://github.com/shvchk) install, modified to work with this theme.

- **Secure way:**

  - Download install script:

    ```sh
    wget -P /tmp https://github.com/pizzasqueeze/Thinkpad-Grub-Theme/raw/master/install.sh
    ```

  - Review it at `/tmp/install.sh`

  - Run it:

    ```sh
    bash /tmp/install.sh
    ```

- **Easier, less secure way** â€” just download and run install script:

  ```sh
  wget -O - https://github.com/pizzasqueeze/Thinkpad-Grub-Theme/raw/master/install.sh | bash
  ```
